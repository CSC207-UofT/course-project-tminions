# Scenario Walk-Through

Let's say hypothetically for the sake of this scenario walkthrough we want to look at some current news. To attain such a goal we will open the comprehensive RSS reader BinoculaRSS and check the RSS feed for our 2 "favourite" news sites tyt.com and infowars.com. Opening BinoculaRSS we will see a list (output by CommandLineInterface) of the newest articles written (sorted by date by Operations) collected  from the various feeds we have subscribed to (listed in FeedGroup). First we want to check tyt.com so we open the feed menu (sent information by FeedReader) that contains the list of all the feeds we are subscribed to and we specify that we would only like to view the tyt feed. This shows us a list of articles (gathered by ArticleReader) from only tyt.com from which we can click on and read further (also gathered by ArticleReader).

After having had our fill of tyt we decide to now check infowars.com, however we realise that we've forgotten to add infowars.com to our RSS feed. We can use the add RSS feed functionality to input the RSS feed for infowars.com (UI calling FeedGroup.addFeed), which adds it to the lists of feeds (in FeedGroup). We can then go and read through the articles in the same way as earlier.
