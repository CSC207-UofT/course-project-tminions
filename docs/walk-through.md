# Scenario Walk-Through

Let's say hypothetically for the sake of this scenario walkthrough I want to look at some current news. To attain such a goal I will open the comprehensive RSS reader Binocularss and check the RSS feed for my 2 favourite news sites tyt.com and infowars.com. Opening Binocularss I will see a list of the newest articles (Operations) written collected (CmdUI)) from the various feeds I'm subscribed too (ArticleReader). First I want to check tyt.com so I open the feed menu (FeedReader) that contains the list of all the feeds I'm subscribed too and I click on the tyt feed. This shows me a list of articles (ArticleReader) from only tyt.com from which I can click on and read further (ArticleReader).

After having had my fill of tyt I decide to now check infowars.com, however I realise that I've forgotten to add infowars.com to my RSS feed. I can use the add RSS feed functionality to input the RSS feed for infowars.com (CmdUI), which adds it to the lists of feeds (FeedGroup). I can then go and read through the articles in the same way as earlier.
