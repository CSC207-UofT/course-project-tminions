# Progress Report
For our CSC207 project, our group (Tminions) decided to add an RSS Reader.

For our Phase 0, our main goals were to determine our main goals, create a thorough CRC model alongside scenario walk-throughs, and then implement a basic working skeleton program. By keeping SOLID principles and Clean Architecture in mind, we created a foundation to build our project on top of.

## Specification Summary:
We decided to create a mobile (Android app), feature rich, RSS reader. An RSS feed allows users to subscribe to various feeds (new websites such as CNN, blogging websites such as Tumblr, and even Youtube) and takes in a standardized, computer-readable format and outputs it as a reader. Some key features we wanted to highlight were:
- Object-oriented representation of the RSS Feed
  - A feed that stores and view articles through a scroll format (similar to Reddit)
  - Different modes to view the feed (reverse chronological, from a single feed)
  - Different tabs to view different articles
We wanted to prioritize useful features that traditional readers have such as bookmarking, offline mode and share functions while maintaining the simplicity of RSS feeds as opposed to the bloat that modern readers have.

## CRC Model Summary:
Our CRC Model is based around 3 main entities: "Article", "Feed", and "FeedGroup". The rest of our classes follow SOLID principles and Clean Architecture, modifying these data structures using controllers, as well as use cases/user interface.
