# BinoculaRSS Specification

<!-- clarify what the specification entails -->

## Purpose

A mobile, feature rich, RSS reader. RSS stands for Really Simply Syndication. RSS is essentially a "web feed that allows users and applications to access websites in a standardized, computer-readable format." - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS). Users can subscribe to RSS feeds to keep track of many different websites in one place. This place is an RSS reader.

## Features
