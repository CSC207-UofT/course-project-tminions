# Phase 2 - Updated Specification
Overall we followed our initial specification closely but there are multiple new additions to highlight.

### Proper UI
Our skeleton program for phase 0 was barebones in terms of the user interface. Since then we've worked on implementing a functional and good-looking user interface that enhances the user experience of our app.

### Room Database
Since phase 0 we've added the Room library to implement data persistence in our program. This allows our users to save their feeds and articles over multiple lifecycles of the program, without having to fetch them again.

### Priority
We decided against implementing a priority feature as it proved too complex for this program.
