## Significant PR examples:

#### Benson Chou

Pull Request - [Delete Feed](https://github.com/tminions/binocularss/pull/20)

This pull request added the ability to delete a feed which was important for
giving the user more freedom.


#### **Eamon Ma**

Pull Request - [Curated Feeds](https://github.com/tminions/binocularss/pull/33)

This pull request implemented curated feeds which were essentially feeds that we handpicked as suggestions for the user. This was important for improving the overall
user experience.  

#### **Hisbaan Noorani**

Pull Request - [Bookmarks refactor](https://github.com/tminions/binocularss/pull/17)

This pull request was important for reducing code duplication and making user experience a lot more fluid by using a View instead of an activity.

Pull Request - [Standardize padding, shape, typography](https://github.com/tminions/binocularss/pull/25)

This pull request replaced a lot of the hard coded values for styling with variables defined elsewhere which made code more readable.


#### **Ismail Ahmed**

Pull Request - [Search Function](https://github.com/tminions/binocularss/pull/23)

This pull request added search functionality to our application which was critical to
making our application fulfill our specification. 

Pull Request - [Database Gateway](https://github.com/tminions/binocularss/pull/26)

This pull request was significant because it added a gateway class that reduces coupling between the UI and the database. 

#### **Macdeini Niu**

Pull Request - [Reading History](https://github.com/tminions/binocularss/pull/22)

This pull request implements reading history that will display a list of articles that have been marked as read.  

#### **Salman Husainie**

Pull Request - [Fetch Feed](https://github.com/tminions/binocularss/pull/30)

This pull request implemented a boundary between our UI as well as an interface between our Use Case and UI which was important for adhering to clean architecture.


#### **Simon Chen**

Pull Request - [URL Trimming](https://github.com/tminions/binocularss/pull/19)

This pull request implements url trimming when the user inputs a url for a feed they want to add. This was important because it could potentially have been a very inconvenient bug.
